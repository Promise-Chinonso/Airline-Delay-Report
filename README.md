 Project Name: Airline Delay Report
 ----
 Project Statement: To determine the trend of airline/flight delays across different parameters and also profer solutions that will help with future flight preparations by airline companies and passengers 
 ----
 Data Source: The dataset was gotten in its raw form from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay
 ----
 Data Transformation:
 ----
 I ensured every field in the dataset was presented in the right format (e.g, date, text, whole number,binary)
 ----
 I filtered out the row that had the information for the delayed flights to be used in the power query editor
 ----
 With powerbi, i was able to create a quick measure that gave me a count of the delayed flights which i used in some of the charts 
 ----
 Data Visualization: I used an area graph to show the changes in the count of delay over time, the bar graphs accurately represented the top parameters in the dataset field in view, a pie-chart was used to show the percentage of flights that were normal and the percentage that were delayed

 ----
 Data Insights:
 ----
 44.54% of the total flights were delayed
 ----
 Airline 'WN' and Airport 'ATL' experienced the most delays
 ----
 Tuesday and Wednesday has the most recorded airline delays 
 ----
 Recommendations: Passengers should consider booking their flights on weekend since there are lower records for delays on weekends
